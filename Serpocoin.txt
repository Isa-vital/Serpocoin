🛸 About Serpo Coin

Serpo Coin is a visionary Web3 project inspired by one of humanity’s greatest mysteries — Project Serpo, the alleged 1960s exchange between Earth and beings from the Zeta Reticuli system.

Reimagined for the blockchain era, Serpo Coin transforms this legend into a living digital civilization — where community, technology, and imagination unite.

Launched exclusively on Blum Meme Pad under Ton network Serpo Coin stands on a foundation of trust and decentralization.\
With a renounced contract and a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens, Serpo Coin belongs fully to its community — no owner, no limits, only evolution.
